java hotel booking system  

OVERVIEW    
Welcome to our Hotel Booking System project, a collaborative effort by our dedicated team to provide a streamlined and user-friendly platform for hotel reservations. This system is designed with a focus on simplicity, ensuring a seamless experience for users while offering the potential for expansion to include multiple hotels.  
  
FEATURES  
User-Centric Booking: Our system prioritizes the user's experience, placing them in control of the booking process. Users can effortlessly browse available rooms, select their preferred accommodations, and complete the reservation with ease.  
Scalability: While currently featuring a single hotel, our system is built to scale, accommodating the inclusion of multiple hotels in the future. This flexibility ensures adaptability to the evolving needs of the hospitality industry.  
Intuitive Design: We've adopted a clean and intuitive design to enhance user navigation. The interface is thoughtfully crafted to provide a straightforward booking process, minimizing complexity and maximizing user satisfaction.  

In order to start the frontend Homepage:
npm run start  

In order to run the java system:   
Ensure that the file "mysql-connector-j-8.3.0.jar" is downloaded in the folder.  
Add the "mysql-connector-j-8.3.0.jar" file as a dependency within the project structure. In some cases, this would require you to move the jar file into another directory and to manually add it as a dependency in the project structure yourself.
Remember to also run XAMPP and import the SQL file provided.
